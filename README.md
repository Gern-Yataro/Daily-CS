Solutions for computer science daily challenges

## [Report] April 2019
0. Learned prime number sieving algorithms, binomial coefficient, modulo (%) use cases and type casting use cases
1. Recursion is best used in certain cases but not all, some solution can be done with loops instead 
2. Using recursion for factorials and fibonacci sequence was a REALLY BAD IDEA
