# Project Euler Report
Solutions for computer science challenges

### April 2019
---
1. Learned prime number sieving algorithms, binomial coefficient, modulo (%) use cases and type casting use cases
2. Recursion is best used in certain cases but not all, some solution can be done with loops instead 
3. Using recursion for factorials and fibonacci sequence was a REALLY BAD IDEA
4. However, if you're using a language/implementation that guarantees tail recursion elimination and automatic memoization, quite a few cases that have obvious iterative solutions can be implemented recursively with little or no loss of efficiency or readability
5. Tower of Hanoi with recursion went very well
6. Use BigInteger for extremely large numbers, or you can create your own alternative with arrays, using the concept of carrying
7. Learned and applied basics of dynamic programming
8. Learned and applied tail recursion

### May 2019
---
1. Learned various sorting algorithms, their time complexity, pros and cons and applications.
2. Learned Big O Notation
3. Learned Python list, dictionary methods and formats. Also, Python does not implement tail recursion, which makes creating recursive algorithms a problem. Hence, the sorting algorithms created are more inclined towards an iterative approach
